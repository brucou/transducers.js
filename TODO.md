- remove startWith 
  - it is not possible to do startWith(a) with transducers
  - work around is to do concat([a], ...) or compose(concat(b)) so reversing order
  - because transducers cannot look ahead, they are local and then pass forward
  - compose(concat(b)) is the way to go, the other one is not a transducer...
  - concat transducer will require handling error and completion nicely...
- more transducers for observables
  - concat
  - flatMap
  - flatMapLatest
  - concatMap
- README to update explaining the observable API
- up to minor version when done
